# WristWhiz_MediaPipe
Ufactory xarm6 robot with D435 camera, using Mediapipe for wrist tracking. This code enables the robot to follow the user's wrist within its working radius, demonstrating real-time interaction and precision movement control.

**Overview**

This repository contains the code and resources for a robotic arm application using the Ufactory xarm6, integrated with a D435 camera and utilizing the Mediapipe framework. The primary functionality of this system is to enable the robotic arm to dynamically track and follow the user's wrist movements within its operational radius.

**Features**

  _Robotic Arm Control_: Utilizes Ufactory xarm6 for precise and responsive movements.
  
  _Advanced Vision Capabilities_: Integrates the D435 camera to capture and process visual data in real-time.
  
  _Wrist Tracking_: Employs the Mediapipe framework to accurately track the user's wrist movements.
  
  _Responsive Interaction_: The robot arm follows the user's wrist movements within its designated working radius, allowing for interactive applications.
